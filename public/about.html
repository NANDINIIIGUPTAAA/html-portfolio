<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Nandini gupta. A highly motivated college student with a strong passion for computer science, I have a background in
 combining technical knowledge with exceptional interpersonal skills. I'm adept at troubleshooting hardware 
 and software issues to deliver optimal solutions. I'm also actively involved in social life as the Social Chair
 for my fraternity, organizing successful events and fostering a sense of community. I demonstrate dedication to
 making a positive impact through my volunteer work at the Humane Society, contributing time and skills to 
 support local animals. In addition, I'm majoring in Computer Science, with coursework emphasizing programming 
 languages, algorithms, and data structures.</p>

<p>I am working on a web development.My biggest strength is my passion for learning new things.
 As a quick learner, I enjoy learning new skills and applying them to my work. 
I am pursuing btech. I am a girl who loves to create websites as for people and passionate to learn new things by practicing. 
I think that people should look at the bigger picture when they are building 
 something. I love to work in groups where everyone can voice their opinions and ideas. In the end, I love to 
 work towards one goal where in the end we all can contribute towards making a good website. 
 In my free time, you can see me listening to songs and binge-watching series when 
 I am not working with my clients.</p>
